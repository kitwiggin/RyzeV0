# For Alex

### Install

Assuming you have NPM installed and running, should be relatively straightforward

Start by doing a `npm install`

### Running

Again, a simple `npm start` should do it - any issues might have to do with local access restrictions on your laptop and/or incorrect installation of packages

From there, `localhost:3000` should work (and probably auto-open in default browser)

### Using site

atm, `/` should take you to something that vaguely looks like Twitter homepage. Menu bar on the left (doesn't work), centre piece is feed with some bollocks ones I've made and a tweetbox at the top to make a tweet.

Assuming you're not logged in, the right hand side will have a poorly designed component with some text directing you to log in. This should take you to a login/create account page - make an account however you like (probs buggy) - its all handled by a package so i cant see any login info.

To go to a user's page, you just need the url to be `.../profile/username`. Hopefully, it should show you tweets made by that account, as well as look different depending on if its the current users page or not (follow etc. if someone else, edit profile if yours). Editing is very wip but in general should work, it just loses track of tweets made if username changes...

lmk abt any bugs etc. you find along the way xx

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
